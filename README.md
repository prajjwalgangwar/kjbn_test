# KJNL Test App

## Overview
The KJNL Test app is a single-page Flutter application designed to showcase proficiency in Flutter development.

## Requirements
To run the app, ensure you have the latest Flutter and Dart versions installed.

## Splash Screen
The app features an engaging splash screen that displays an animated logo of KJNL Test for 3 seconds upon opening.

## State Management with BLOC Pattern
The application leverages the BLOC pattern, with the `HomeBloc` taking charge of managing various states. This ensures a clean and efficient approach to handling state within the app.

## Local Data Storage with Shared Preferences
For local data storage, the app utilizes Shared Preferences. This enables the seamless retention of essential data even after closing and reopening the app.

## Repository Pattern
The repository pattern is employed to establish a smooth connection between the BLOC layer and the database. This enhances the overall structure and maintainability of the codebase.

## Getting Started
1. Download and install the latest versions of Flutter and Dart.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the app on Android or iOS emulators, or physical devices.
